## üîç Query Explanations

- **Read Queries**: Retrieve students, instructors, course info, enrollments, and assignments using filters and projections.
- **Update Queries**: Used `$set`, `$addToSet`, and `$inc` to update profile info, add tags, update grades.
- **Aggregation**: Performed grouping, lookup, and project stages for analytics like:
  - Average grades
  - Completion rates
  - Monthly enrollments
- **Delete Queries**: Implemented soft delete for users, and hard delete for enrollments and lessons.

All queries include appropriate error handling using `try-except` blocks.

## ‚ö° Performance Analysis Results

### Indexed Fields
- `users.email` (unique)
- `courses.title`, `courses.category`
- `assignments.dueDate`
- `enrollments.studentId`, `enrollments.courseId`

### Optimization Example

| Query                          | Before Index | After Index |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `courses.find({"category": "Programming"})` | 4.49 ms      | 1.01 ms     |
| `users.find({"email": ...})`  | 3.87 ms      | 0.86 ms     |
| `assignments.find({"dueDate": ...})` | 2.98 ms      | 0.92 ms     |

Used `.explain("executionStats")` and Python `time.perf_counter()` for benchmarking.

## üöß Challenges Faced and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Enforcing schema rules in MongoDB | Used `$jsonSchema` validator on collections |
| Handling missing fields or wrong data types | Added robust error handling (`WriteError`, `DuplicateKeyError`) |
| Joining across collections in NoSQL | Used `$lookup` and `$unwind` in aggregation pipelines |
| Tracking performance gains | Measured using `explain()` and `time.perf_counter()` |
| Data duplication during insertions | Ensured unique `_id` usage and index enforcement |
